# FYS_STK_project1

## FYS-STK4155 - Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learning - Autumn 2024

### Project Description
This project focuses on applied data analysis and machine learning techniques, specifically for terrain data and data from the Franke function. The goal of this project is to learn about different regression methods and how they apply to topographic data and two-dimensional functions.

### Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/rudi191/FYS_STK_project1.git

    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Project Structure
