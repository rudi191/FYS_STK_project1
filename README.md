# FYS_STK_project1

## FYS-STK4155 - Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learning - Autumn 2024

### Project Description
This project focuses on applied data analysis and machine learning techniques, specifically for terrain data and data from the Franke function. The goal of this project is to learn about different regression methods and how they apply to topographic data and two-dimensional functions.

### Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/rudi191/FYS_STK_project1.git

    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn imageio seaborn
    if python3 run:
    pip3 install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn imageio seaborn
    ```

### Project Structure
- **Datafiles/**: Contains `.tif` files used as input data for the project.
- **Final Code/**: Contains the final Python code for exercises related to terrain data and Franke data.
- **Results/figures/**: Contains the figures obtained from running the code.
- **Supplemental material/**: Contains GPT chat files and some leftover code.
